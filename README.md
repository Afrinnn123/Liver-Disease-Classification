## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
About ILPD(Indian Liver Patient Dataset): The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) contains medical records of 583 patients from Northeast Andhra Pradesh, India. It comprises 10 features including the patient's age, gender, various blood test results like bilirubin levels, enzymes related to liver function (alkaline phosphatase, alamine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), total proteins, albumin, and albumin/globulin ratio. The target variable indicates whether the patient has liver disease or not(1 for liver disease, 2 for no liver disease), with 416 instances labeled as having liver disease and 167 instances without. A notable aspect is that patient ages over 89 are truncated to 90. The dataset does not contain any missing values. With its moderate size and a diverse set of relevant features, this dataset provides a valuable resource for liver disease classification task.
